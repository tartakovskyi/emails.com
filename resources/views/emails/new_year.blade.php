Dear {{$first_name}}, 
<p>As this new year marks a new beginning in our life, I would like to take this opportunity to thank each one of you for your excellent performances last year. Last year has been a great year as far as achieving our targets are concerned.</p>
<p>We have a huge number of projects coming up next year, and I am sure that with all your dedication and determination, we will be able to complete those also in time. I thank you all for your support and hope this relationship continues, and we achieve success together.</p>
<p>My best wishes to you and your families for a safe, happy holiday season and a happy new year.</p>
